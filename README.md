# Networking

Virtual Networks provide a layer of isolation for your compute and data resources in the cloud and are can be carved up into subnets like an on-premises network.  However, Azure Virtual Networks don't have to be isolated to cloud-only deployments.  In fact, it is common for today's Solution Architect to have to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments.  See how you can extend an on-premises network to Azure Virtual Networks using point-to-site, site-to-site, and private connections using ExpressRoute.  Understand scenarios appropriate for each solution.  Then, see how to conquer multi-site networking topologies and how network security groups and access control lists can be used to further protect resources.  Finally, understand how to leverage the load-balancing features of Azure (internal and external) to achieve highly available architectures.
